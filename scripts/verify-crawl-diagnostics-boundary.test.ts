 * TD-UI-064 — PERMANENT invariant of CrawlDiagnostics: the login-surface observation
 * boundary TRAVELS WITH the value. `observationView` is the SOLE gate the card renders
 * through, so a value can never reach the DOM without its boundary. A 'withheld' view
 * carries NO value/mechanism/boundary — only an explicit statement — so nothing bare can be
 * shown. No exception for a pre-rename model (missing observationBoundary), a blank boundary,
 * or a future signal that supplies none. Rendering a value without its blind spot is the
 * exact TD-148 defect the component exists to prevent.
