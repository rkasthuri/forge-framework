/**
 * TD-UI-061 — surgical-bridge proof (B1–B4).
 *
 * The deprecated src/platform dashboard header health badge must NOT fabricate
 * green on absent / could-not-verify evidence. The resolution + presentation were
 * extracted into src/platform/healthState.ts (a pure, side-effect-free seam —
 * dashboard-server.ts starts an HTTP server at import, so it can't be imported
 * directly; SEAM ADDED, noted per the brief). These tests exercise that seam.
 *
 * node:test + node:assert/strict under tsx (auto-covered by `npm run test:unit`).
