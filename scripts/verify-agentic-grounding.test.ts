 * TD-013 Phase 3 (Block 2a) — grounding guard tests.
 *   G1 all-observed actions        → 'observed'
 *   G2 one inferred among observed  → 'inferred' (the whole goal is a hypothesis)
 *   G3 empty actions[]              → 'inferred' (zero evidence is never the stronger claim)
 *   G4 IMMUTABILITY                 → derivation reads, never writes grounding
 *
 * Type-level immutability: AgentAction.grounding is declared `readonly`, so a
 * write like `act.grounding = 'inferred'` fails to COMPILE — the strongest guard.
 * G4 below is belt-and-suspenders proof that the runtime path never mutates.
