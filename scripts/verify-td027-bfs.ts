// TD-027 (BFS half) direct repro: constructs a small, realistic BFS crawl
// shape where visit-order and real outboundUrls disagree, then replays it
// through the real (private) buildRoleStateEdges() method to confirm the
// fix changes actual edge output, not just confirms an already-correct case.
//
// Shape: A (home) links to B (products) and C (about); B links to D (cart);
// C is a dead end. A real BFS queue visits in order A, B, C, D (A's two
// children get queued before B's child D is discovered) -- so visit-order
// pairing would wire B->C (siblings, B never links to C) and C->D (C has no
// outbound links at all; D is only reachable from B) -- both fabricated.
