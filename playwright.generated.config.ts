/**
 * playwright.generated.config.ts
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * Minimal config for validating generated tests in src/tests/generated/.
 * Used by the platform's Save & Run button and for direct CLI validation.
 *
 * Does NOT write to run-history.json -- validation only, not a tracked run.
 *
 * Migration convention:
 *   Once a generated test is reviewed and promoted to the permanent suite,
 *   move it to that app's own tests/migrated/ folder (e.g.
 *   src/apps/desktop/ui/saucedemo/tests/migrated/) -- NOT src/tests/generated/migrated/,
 *   which was the originally documented path here but was never actually used.
 *   Keep "generated" out of the migrated path entirely: playwright.config.ts's
 *   chromium/webkit projects exclude any path containing a "generated" segment,
 *   and its "generated" project's testMatch picks up any path containing one --
 *   a migrated-but-still-"generated"-named folder gets silently routed to the
 *   wrong project and the wrong baseURL.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx playwright test tc066-login.spec.ts --config=playwright.generated.config.ts --project=chromium
 *   npx playwright test --config=playwright.generated.config.ts   <- run all NEW generated tests
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
