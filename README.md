## What FORGE Is

FORGE is an AI-augmented Quality Engineering platform and applied research project focused on building reliable, evidence-driven software testing.

Rather than treating AI as a code generator, FORGE applies AI throughout the testing lifecycle — application understanding, test generation, execution, triage, healing, and continuous learning — while grounding every decision in observable evidence.

The project serves as both an engineering platform and an experimental environment for advancing trustworthy, explainable AI-assisted Quality Engineering.

> *"This isn't just another Playwright framework. It's a question about how to build AI that earns its confidence rather than assumes it."*

---

## Why FORGE Exists

Traditional automation frameworks generate scripts. FORGE is built around a different philosophy:

| Principle | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|
| **Observe before Assert** | FORGE crawls and witnesses app behaviour before making any claim about it |
| **Evidence before Confidence** | Confidence scores are derived from what was actually observed — never assumed |
| **Never Invent Specificity** | If FORGE can't verify something, it says so — it never fabricates a confident answer |
| **AI must be Explainable** | Every AI decision carries a reason, not just a result |
| **Every Capability needs an Eval** | No AI feature ships without a measurable evaluation harness |
| **Learn from Production, not Assumptions** | The app model updates from real observed behaviour, not static documentation |

These aren't slogans — they are reflected in the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and enforced throughout the codebase.

## Where AI Changes the Game

Traditional automation still relies heavily on people to notice change, diagnose it, and manually update scripts. The table below shows where AI closes that gap — and where human judgment still leads.

| QE Activity | Traditional Automation | FORGE — AI-Augmented |
|---|---|---|
| **Mapping the application** | SDET manually explores and documents pages/flows | FORGE crawls the live app and builds the map automatically |
| **Deciding what to test** | Human judgment per app, per sprint | AI applies consistent rules at scale — no fatigue, no bias |
| **Writing test scripts** | Hand-coded, line by line, for every flow | Generated directly from the observed app model |
| **Maintaining tests when the app changes** | Find the failure → hunt the script → understand the change → fix manually | FORGE detects the change, diagnoses the cause, updates the test automatically |
| **Diagnosing failures** | A red X — someone digs through logs to determine if it's a real bug | AI classifies root cause before a human looks at it |
| **Selector stability — self-healing** | Broken element ID = broken test, until someone fixes it | FORGE re-locates the element and updates the test, with safeguards against false heals |
| **API contract changes** | Generic failure → manual trace-back to what changed | Contract drift detected — affected tests updated |
| **Trust in results** | Pass/fail with no nuance — a pass can hide a weak check | Every result is evidence-tagged: how it was verified, and how confident FORGE is |
| **Scaling to new applications** | Custom automation logic per app | Zero app-specific hardcoding — the same pipeline runs any web app |

> **What AI does not change:** Business risk priorities, edge case judgment, and what "correct" means for a given feature. Those remain human decisions. FORGE is designed to make that judgment easier, not to replace it.

---

## Agentic Capabilities — What's Being Built

FORGE is moving beyond scripted pipeline steps toward AI agents that can plan, act, observe, and decide autonomously.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph AGENT ["🤖 Agentic Crawl Loop"]
        direction LR
        P["📋 PLAN\nSet goal\nDecompose steps"]
        A["🎯 ACT\nExecute in\nreal browser"]
        O["👁️ OBSERVE\nRecord what\nactually happened"]
        D["🧠 DECIDE\nContinue · backtrack\nor escalate"]

        P --> A --> O --> D --> P
    end

    G([Goal]) --> P
    O --> M[(GoalMemory\ncross-session)]
    M -.->|Prior knowledge| P
```

| Agentic Capability | Status | Design Principle |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal-directed crawl** | 🔄 In progress | Agent sets a goal (e.g. "reach checkout") and plans the steps to get there — rather than blindly following links |
| **Prerequisite execution** | 🔄 In progress | Agent performs required steps (add to cart, login) before verifying stateful pages — evidence is genuinely observed, not assumed |
| **Cross-session GoalMemory** | 🔄 In progress | Agent remembers what it learned across runs — doesn't re-explore proven paths |
| **Supervised / Autonomous mode** | 🔄 In progress | CLI flag (`--supervised` / `--autonomous`) controls how much the agent acts without confirmation — default is supervised for safety |
| **Confidence decay** | 🗓️ Planned | Older observations lose confidence over time — forces re-verification rather than trusting stale models |
| **Bootstrap Mode** | 🔄 In progress | Point FORGE at any URL — it auto-detects app type, auth, and crawl strategy, generates the config, and begins crawling |

> **Core constraint:** Agentic exploration must make evidence real by observing it. The agent is never permitted to synthesize or infer paths it has not actually navigated — that would violate the foundational evidence principle.

---

## AI Failure Triage — Evidence Gate

Every test failure is classified by AI before a human looks at it. The classification cannot exceed the quality of available evidence.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    F([Test Failure]) --> E{Evidence\nGate}
    E -->|Positive evidence of\napp regression| A[🔴 app-bug]
    E -->|Wrong assertion or\nbad test logic| B[🟡 test-defect]
    E -->|Timeout · network\nenv instability| C[🟠 infra-defect]
    E -->|Non-deterministic\nacross runs| D[🟣 flaky]
    E -->|Cannot determine\nwith confidence| U[⚪ insufficient-evidence]
```

**Validation results against live apps:**
- **0% false app-bug rate** — the evidence gate prevents AI from guessing
- **97.4% triage accuracy** on evaluation harness
- `insufficient-evidence` is a first-class outcome — not a fallback, not an error

---

## Engineering Philosophy

These principles are not aspirational — they are enforced in the architecture and documented in the ADRs.

```
Observe before Assert.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every claim FORGE makes must be earned from real observation.
Inference without evidence is not permitted.

Evidence before Confidence.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Confidence scores are derived — never assumed.
A healing action can never be more confident
than the evidence it was built on.

Never Invent Specificity.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
ADR-011: The generator must not assert things
it cannot verify. "I don't know" is a valid,
correct, and sometimes the only honest answer.

AI must be Explainable.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every triage decision carries a reason.
Every heal carries a confidence tier.
No silent decisions.

Every Capability needs an Eval.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
No AI feature is considered shipped until
it has a measurable evaluation harness
with a ground-truth dataset and a pass threshold.

Learn from Production, not Assumptions.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
The app model is updated from real observed
behaviour. Static documentation, guesses,
and stale models are not trusted sources.
```

## Evaluation Harnesses

FORGE validates its own AI capabilities with measurable, reproducible evals — not manual spot-checks.

| Eval | What It Measures | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Triage eval** | Accuracy of 5-category failure classification | 97.4% accuracy · 0% false app-bug rate |
| **Generation eval** | Behavioural correctness of generated test specs | 100% pass rate · 6/6 SauceDemo specs |
| **Healing eval** | Correctness of automated selector repair | 100% correct heal rate on validation set |

> These numbers are earned, not claimed. Each eval has a ground-truth dataset, a runner, and a reporter — all in `/evals`.

---

## Live Test Targets

FORGE is validated against three structurally different real applications — not a single toy example.

| App | Type | What FORGE Tests |
|---|---|---|
| [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) | Traditional multi-page UI | Auth flows, product listing, cart, checkout, role-based access |
| [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com) | Complex SPA | Employee management, deep navigation, multi-role access |
| [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com) | REST API | Endpoint discovery, CRUD, contract validation, drift detection |
