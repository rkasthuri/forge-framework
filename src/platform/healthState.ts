/**
 * TD-UI-061 — SURGICAL BRIDGE for the deprecated src/platform dashboard header
 * health badge.
 *
 * The badge previously fell through to 'Healthy' (bright green) whenever no
 * adverse signal was present — INCLUDING when there was NO evidence at all (empty
 * run set) or when the latest run was one FORGE could-not-verify. That is a
 * fabricated green: absence of a failure signal is not proof of health
 * (ADR-015 no-hardcoded-confidence), and a could-not-verify run is not a pass
 * (ADR-018 aggregate-to-the-weakest-truth).
 *
 * This module is the extracted, side-effect-free resolution + presentation so it
 * is unit-testable (dashboard-server.ts starts an HTTP server at import, so its
 * internals cannot be imported directly). It is a BRIDGE to stop a live lie —
 * NOT investment in the deprecated surface. The real fix is the honest DB-backed
 * forge-ui dashboard (TD-UI-062); src/platform retires with the Dashboard
 * milestone. Touch nothing else here.
