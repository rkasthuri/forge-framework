/**
 * TD-013 Phase 3 (Block 2a) — derived goal-grounding.
 *
 * A goal's grounding is DERIVED from its actions, never stored, so it cannot
 * drift from the evidence it summarizes. Mirrors FlowDetector.finalizeFlowStatus
 * exactly: the whole is 'observed' only when EVERY part is observed; anything
 * less — including zero evidence — is 'inferred'. An empty action set is
 * 'inferred', never 'observed': zero evidence is never the stronger claim
 * (the honesty floor — no evidence is not a passing default).
 *
 * Reads only; never mutates. AgentAction.grounding is `readonly`, so the
 * immutability this function relies on is also enforced at the type level.
