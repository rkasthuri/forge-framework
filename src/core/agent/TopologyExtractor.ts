 * TD-013 Phase 3 (Block 2b) — CrawlTopology producers.
 *
 * topologyFromAppModel: the MODEL-BASED producer. Reads a PERSISTED AppModel — its
 * pages[] for selectors and its flows[].steps[] for transitions — and projects them into
 * the decoupled CrawlTopology the recipe-writer (2c) consumes. StateGraph is NOT persisted
 * on AppModel (it is an in-memory crawl intermediate discarded after FlowDetector derives
 * flows), so the persisted, grounded, element-resolved transition record IS the FlowStep.
 *
 * HONESTY GUARD: grounding is COPIED 1:1 from FlowStep. This extractor NEVER recomputes or
 * upgrades it. A FlowStep with no grounding (legacy/undefined) becomes 'inferred', never
 * 'observed' — zero/absent evidence is never promoted to the stronger claim.
