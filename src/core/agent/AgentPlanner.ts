/**
 * TD-013 Commit 2 — AgentPlanner (Phase 1).
 *
 * A PURE planner: no browser, no HTTP, no file I/O. It operates entirely on the
 * types in ./types and drives the injected ExecutionEnvironment (dependency
 * injection) so it is fully unit-testable with a fake environment.
 *
 * Phase 1 scope: goals are HAND-AUTHORED (GoalDefinition config), not
 * auto-discovered (that's Phase 2). Decomposition is a topological sort over the
 * prerequisite DAG; replanning is a bounded, evidence-gated retry; UNREACHABLE is
 * only ever concluded from evidence, never from a single failure.
