/**
 * TD-013 Phase 3 (Block 2b) — CrawlTopology: the synthesizer's UNIFIED INPUT.
 *
 * A decoupled projection of "the app's shape" that the recipe-writer (2c) consumes.
 * Two producers feed it (see TopologyExtractor): a PERSISTED AppModel (pages + flows)
 * and, degenerately, a single live page's PageSignals (bootstrap = 1 node, 0
 * transitions). The synthesizer depends ONLY on this type — never on how it was
 * produced, and never on AppModel/Playwright types (kept out on purpose so the
 * projection cannot drift toward its source).
 *
 * `kind` / `action` / `appType` are plain strings here on purpose: the projection is a
 * VIEW, deliberately independent of the onboarding-layer unions it happens to mirror.
