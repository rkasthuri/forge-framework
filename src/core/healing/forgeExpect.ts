/**
 * TD-065 — forgeExpect: a thin dispatcher around Playwright's `expect`.
 *
 * FixtureGenerator aliases generated specs' `expect` to this. Behaviour:
 *   - Page / raw Locator target  -> pass straight through to Playwright's expect.
 *     A raw `page.locator(selector)` has no SmartLocatorDef, so there is nothing
 *     to heal (Option C). Full assertion-layer healing needs the generator to emit
 *     SmartLocator-backed spec assertions — see the Option-B follow-up TD.
 *   - SmartLocator target        -> heal via resolve({assertionType}) + re-assert,
 *     so a broken selector is repaired AND its correctness re-verified (TD-065
 *     Tier 1) before the assertion runs.
 *
 * Detection uses the `__isSmartLocator` brand (SmartLocator.ts) so it survives
 * duplicate class identities that would defeat a bare `instanceof`.
