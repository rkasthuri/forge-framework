/**
 * ADR-018 RED-SIDE — the could-not-verify cross-boundary vocabulary.
 *
 * `FORGE_COULD_NOT_VERIFY` is the structured Playwright annotation TYPE that
 * carries a "could-not-verify" verdict across the spec→ingestion boundary. It
 * survives on `TestResult.annotations` (reporter API) AND `JSONReportTest.
 * annotations` (batch JSON), so BOTH ingestion readers can re-grade a
 * heal-caused failure to could-not-verify instead of a demonstrated defect.
 *
 * PURE module (no external imports) so the ingestion extractor
 * (testResultExtraction.ts) stays unit-test-importable without pulling in
 * Playwright. The producer-side helper that actually calls `test.info()` lives
 * with the producer (SmartLocator.ts), which already depends on Playwright.
