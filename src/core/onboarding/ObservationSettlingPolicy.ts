/**
 * TD-110 — ObservationSettlingPolicy: reusable abstraction for waiting until
 * a page has revealed its evidence.
 *
 * Nova-approved (TD-110 design review).
 *
 * Problem: SPAs render content client-side after domcontentloaded. Detectors
 * that run immediately after page.goto() observe an incomplete page state —
 * live-confirmed on OrangeHRM, whose Vue-rendered login form appears after
 * hydration, so detectAuthType counted 0 password fields and concluded
 * authType 'none' (the TD-110 root cause).
 *
 * Solution: an injectable settling policy that waits for EVIDENCE rather than
 * sleeping for a fixed time. The timeout is the OUTER BOUND, not the
 * mechanism (Nova ruling: evidence-driven settling, not clock-driven).
 *
 * Future consumers: auth detection, strategy detection, nav detection, modal
 * detection, shadow DOM, React suspense, Vue hydration — one interface.
