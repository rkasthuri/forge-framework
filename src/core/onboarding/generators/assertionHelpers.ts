 * TD-082 — shared assertion-capability decisions for the spec generator.
 *
 * Consolidates the evidence-propagation decisions that were derived independently
 * across SpecGenerator's emit sites (FC-001 multiplicity, FC-002 nav grounding,
 * FC-003 observed-state, FC-004a prerequisite/reachability). Pure functions: no
 * side effects, no I/O, only the FlowStep type.
 *
 * Two orthogonal axes (see the SpecGenerator emit sites):
 *   - STEP axis  — grounding of this step + prior steps (determineStepCapability /
 *                  determineClickCapability).
 *   - ELEMENT axis — an element's cardinality + observed state, plus the step
 *                  capability it inherits (determineElementForm).
