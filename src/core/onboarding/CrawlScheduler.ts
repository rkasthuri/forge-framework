/**
 * CrawlScheduler — two work queues, one shared budget, visits-first scheduling.
 *
 * Nova-approved abstraction (TD-130 design review).
 *
 * Budget answers: "How much work may I perform?"
 * Scheduling answers: "Which work should I perform next?"
 *
 * Two queues:
 *   SweepQueue  — BFS-discovered unswept pages
 *                 (click-discovery only, no AI — TD-129)
 *   VisitQueue  — newly-discovered pages to classify
 *                 (full classification, AI budget)
 *
 * Policy: visits-first.
 *   A newly-discovered page is more valuable than another sweep — it's
 *   evidence we haven't seen yet. Sweeps are maintenance on already-known
 *   pages. Pre-TD-130, sweeps monopolized SPA's budget (all 22 BFS seeds
 *   queued ahead of any new page → OrangeHRM 0 new pages at depth 0);
 *   visits-first eliminates that starvation without touching budget
 *   accounting (Nova Q2 unchanged: every page open consumes budget).
 *
 * Depth (TD-130 ruling S1): each work item carries its own depth — the flat
 * queue replaces the old per-generation frontier, so depth is per-item, not
 * per-loop-iteration. Sweeps of BFS pages seed at depth 0; a visit discovered
 * from a page at depth d enqueues at d + 1. Discovery is gated by the
 * consumer: item.depth < maxDepth.
 *
 * Future: agent planner (TD-013) becomes another work producer — slots in as
 * a third queue.
