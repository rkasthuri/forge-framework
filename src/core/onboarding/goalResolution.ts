/**
 * TD-013 Phase 3 (Block 3) — goal resolution: the WRITE and the READER for auto-discovered
 * goals, kept TOGETHER so the channel is never orphaned (ADR-017: a persisted artifact must
 * have a consumer that ships with it).
 *
 * Two-phase, SUPPLEMENT-with-precedence design (ratified):
 *   - WRITE (synthesizeAndPersistGoals): post-crawl, from the COMMITTED model, gated so a
 *     hand-authored config OVERRIDES (never overwritten). Additive — writes an artifact for
 *     a LATER run; does not change the current run's execution.
 *   - READ (resolveGoalDefinitions): precedence user-authored > synthesized > empty.
 *
 * Grounding + origin are carried through untouched: this module never recomputes or
 * promotes them (the recipe-writer is the sole author of the goals; here they are opaque).
