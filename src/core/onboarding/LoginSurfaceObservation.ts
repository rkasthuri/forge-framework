/**
 * TD-148 — login-surface OBSERVATION on crawl auth-failure. OBSERVATION-ONLY.
 *
 * FAILURE-TRIGGERED ONLY (shouldObserveLoginSurface gates it): this fires only when a
 * crawl already failed on auth, so it only ever observes a PRE-AUTH login surface — the
 * door, not the room (Nova). The retired identity-divergence comparison (TD-UI-027) drew
 * conclusions about the APPLICATION behind that door — a domain a pre-auth observation
 * cannot reach. A proposed pre-auth fence would have rendered every signal permanently
 * inconclusive, which proved the comparison never belonged in this execution context.
 * The capability was not evidence-supported and has been RETIRED, not gated.
 *
 * So this surface DRAWS NO CONCLUSION. It records what the login surface showed and
 * asserts nothing beyond it. Each observation carries THREE parts (the honesty
 * requirement — a bare observation carries selection + connotation defects):
 *   (a) the value, factually;
 *   (b) the mechanism — how it was obtained, incl. its blind spot;
 *   (c) the non-implications — what it does NOT indicate, naming the competing causes.
 * Scope is MECHANISM ("what this probe observed"), never RELEVANCE ("what is relevant").
 * Diagnostic context only; FORGE does not infer from it why authentication failed.
