/**
 * PageExplorationRecord — canonical page lifecycle state.
 *
 * Nova-approved abstraction (TD-124 design review).
 *
 * Replaces the overloaded `visited: Set<string>` which conflated three
 * independent facts:
 *   discovered  — a PageDiscovery was produced here
 *   classified  — elements/flows were classified here
 *   swept       — click-discovery was run here (BFS never sweeps; SPA does)
 *
 * The root TD-124 bug: SPAStrategy skipped any URL in `visited`, but "visited"
 * meant "discovered/classified" — so a BFS-discovered page (never swept) was
 * skipped and its click-discovery never ran, losing every click-only page
 * (16/30 on OrangeHRM, live-confirmed). The fix: SPAStrategy checks `swept`,
 * not `discovered`.
 *
 * Future-extensible to: verified, goalExplored, agentVisited, authVerified,
 * firstSeen, explorationDepth, …
 *
 * The Map<string, PageExplorationRecord> (keyed by NORMALIZED URL) replaces
 * `visited: Set<string>` everywhere in the crawl pipeline.
