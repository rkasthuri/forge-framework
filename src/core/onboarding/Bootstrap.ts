/**
 * TD-093 — Bootstrap Mode (detection core) / TD-108 — pure detection engine.
 *
 * Given a URL (+ credentials), Bootstrap probes the live page and produces a
 * BootstrapDetection: each field carries its detected value, a confidence tier,
 * and a human-readable source. `generateConfig()` projects that detection into
 * in-memory BootstrapArtifacts (AppConfig + manifest + evidence package).
 *
 * TD-108: Bootstrap performs NO disk writes and NEVER calls process.exit() —
 * it is a pure detection engine. Persistence (workspace config, manifest,
 * evidence) is owned by the caller (CrawlRunner via Workspace; the CLI bridges
 * this temporarily until Step 6). The .ts fixture generator survives as
 * generateTypeScriptConfig() (@internal, regression fixtures only).
 *
 * Reuses existing detectors rather than inventing new ones: StrategyDetector
 * (crawl mode) and the password-field auth signal (PageVisitor's convention).
 * The net-new observation here is renderingModel (framework/static); the platform
 * (appType) is NOT observed — it is a structural fact of the execution context
 * (ruling 2026-07-21, ADR-020 SCOPE amendment). See TD-093 audit.
 *
 * SECURITY: credentials' username/password are NEVER serialized into the
 * generated config — only a `credentialsEnvKey` pointer is emitted; the secret
 * stays in the environment (same contract as AuthManager.resolveCredentials).
