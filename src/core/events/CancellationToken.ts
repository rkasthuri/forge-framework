 * CancellationToken — cooperative cancellation for long-running engine
 * operations (ADR-012).
 *
 * PHASE 1: a STUB. Constructed and passable, but never triggered — there is no
 * Stop button wired yet, so `cancelled` stays false for a job's whole life.
 *
 * PHASE 2: the UI Stop button → JobRunner.cancel() → token.cancel(); engine
 * methods poll `throwIfCancelled()` at safe checkpoints and unwind cooperatively
 * (close the browser/context in finally) rather than a hard process kill.
 *
 * The contract below is what engine methods will accept as an optional param;
 * passing nothing (CLI, tests, Phase 1) means "never cancelled".
