 * 014 — TD-UI-043: ai_triage gains an `evidence` column (ADR-017 archetype 2).
 *
 * The AI's positive evidence — REQUIRED by the TD-063 evidence-gate for an
 * app-bug verdict (ai-triage.ts:454) — was computed, gated on, carried on
 * TriageResult, and then DISCARDED on the DB write, leaving the persisted verdict
 * unable to substantiate itself. This adds the column so the proof survives.
 *
 * NULLABLE by design (Nova/Aiden): a non-app-bug verdict has no evidence
 * requirement, so NULL honestly means "none was required", not "we lost it".
 * (Distinct from evidence: root_cause is the AI's reasoning NARRATIVE — the gate
 * downgrades an app-bug that has reasoning but no evidence, so the two are not
 * interchangeable.)
 *
 * Idempotent duplicate-swallow mirrors migration 008.
