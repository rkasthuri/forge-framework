/**
 * TD-114 — DatabaseFactory: opens/initializes the per-app project database.
 *
 * Nova-approved seam (Kysely-based, dialect-preserving, NO repository DI):
 *   Workspace       → owns location   (workspace.dbPath() → .forge/forge.db)
 *   DatabaseFactory → owns path-scoping + initialization (this file)
 *   getDb()         → the singleton, unchanged — all 16 repositories keep
 *                     calling it directly; initDb() only decides where it lives
 *
 * Lazy migrations: run on first open (idempotent — Kysely Migrator tracks the
 * kysely_migration table), NOT on workspace creation.
 *
 * Legacy flows (fixture CLI path, VerificationRunner, results-store, scripts)
 * never come through here — they hit getDb()'s DB_PATH/cwd default untouched.
