/**
 * TD-067 — input-health assessment for the triage / results pipeline.
 *
 * The pipeline consumes whatever sits in `reports/test-results.json` and has
 * historically presented its verdicts as the CURRENT run's health with no check
 * that the input is fresh or the run actually executed. This helper computes an
 * honest verdict from the results + the CI provenance sidecar (`reports/
 * provenance.json`, written post-test by the `test` job — TD-067 Commit 2) so
 * callers can surface "stale / degraded / invalid / unverified" instead of
 * laundering old or broken input as current.
 *
 * Honesty principle (same as TD-066): no signal -> say so, never assume healthy.
 * A missing sidecar is 'unknown', NOT 'healthy' — absence of evidence is not
 * evidence of freshness.
 *
 * Shared by both pipeline stages that read the results independently:
 * `results-store.ts` (writes runs.input_health) and `ai-triage.ts` (markdown +
 * confidenceSource) — so the assessment can never drift between them.
