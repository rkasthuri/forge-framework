/**
 * TD-120 — AnalysisPipeline: sequences analysis stages over execution
 * history, producing computed scores and predictions persisted to the DB.
 *
 * Nova-approved abstraction (TD-120 design review) — the middle layer of
 * FORGE's three-layer evidence architecture:
 *
 *   Evidence Collection   → crawl, execution, healing
 *   Evidence Analysis     → THIS pipeline
 *   Evidence Presentation → knowledge-query, dashboard
 *
 * FlakyPredictorStage is Stage 1. Future stages: failure clustering,
 * regression detection, duration trends, risk forecasting, release readiness.
 *
 * Prediction stays DETERMINISTIC — no AI in scoring. AI belongs only in
 * future explanation layers.
 *
 * Same shape as ModelEnrichmentPipeline (fluent addStage, sequential run,
 * per-stage failure isolation) — deliberately, so pipeline authors learn one
 * pattern. The one difference is documented on AnalysisContext.db below.
