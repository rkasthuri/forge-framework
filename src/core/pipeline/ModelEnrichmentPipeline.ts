/**
 * TD-112/TD-122 — ModelEnrichmentPipeline: sequences enrichment stages applied
 * to the AppModel AFTER crawl, BEFORE persistence.
 *
 * Nova-approved abstraction (TD-112 + TD-122 design review):
 *
 *   Crawler    → discovers (returns AppModel — no internal save, TD-122)
 *   Pipeline   → enriches  (stages run sequentially, in-place)
 *   Workspace  → persists  (single write point, via CrawlRunner)
 *
 * Module classification is the FIRST enrichment stage, not a special case —
 * adding a new stage never touches CrawlRunner.
 *
 * Enrichment is SYNCHRONOUS (Nova ruling): one crawl produces one immutable,
 * fully-enriched snapshot; nothing mutates the model after persistence.
