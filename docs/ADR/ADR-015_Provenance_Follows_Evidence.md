# ADR-015: Provenance Follows Evidence

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2026-07-13

## Principle
> "A document may only assert provenance that is directly supported by the
> evidence it contains. **Provenance follows evidence, never the reverse.**" — Nova

A FORGE artifact (app-model, verification report, generation manifest, run
record, crawl summary) records both *what it found* and *the provenance of the
finding* (timestamps, durations, counts, status, confidence). This ADR governs
the relationship between the two: the provenance may only claim what the evidence
supports. A model that found nothing must not carry a `crawledAt`. A verification
that verified nothing must not report HIGH confidence. A run that executed nothing
must not report `passed`.

## Corollaries

**1. Make the lie unrepresentable, not defended-against. (Finn)**
> "A block of metadata tracking an execution must not exist if the execution's
> side-effects are completely absent from the document."

Wrap execution metadata in an explicit **nullable container** so that reading it
on a no-execution artifact is a **type error**, not a plausible value. Preferred
shape: a never-crawled model has `crawlMetadata: null`, so `model.app.crawlMetadata.crawledAt`
does not type-check — the impossible state cannot be written or read by accident.
This is stronger than a runtime guard: guards can be forgotten by the next
consumer; an unrepresentable state cannot.

**2. An outcome field must never DEFAULT to success.**
Zero evidence must produce **zero confidence** or an explicit **"unknown" /
"insufficient evidence"** — never a passing default. `status`, `score`, and
`confidence` are *derived* from evidence or they are `unknown`; they are never
initialized to a value that reads as healthy. A default that reads as success is
a fabrication (TD-066): it asserts a measurement that was never made.

## The correct existing pattern (converge on this)
**HealStore is already correct** and every fix under this ADR should converge on
its two behaviours:
- `HealStore.ts:112-160` — `save()` is gated by `if (!this.dirty) return`
  (`:113`); `dirty` is set true *only* by a real `recordHeal()`/`retireHeal()`.
  No mutation → no timestamped record is written. (Corollary 1: the artifact does
  not exist when the execution's side-effects are absent.)
- `HealStore.ts:33` — `UNVERIFIED_HEAL_CONFIDENCE = -1`, written (`:143`) instead
  of a plausible `1.0` when no correctness signal exists. (Corollary 2: it refuses
  to assert a confidence it did not earn.)

## Context
Triggered by the **TC-04 finding (2026-07-13)**: onboard's bootstrap persists an
`app-model.json` with `crawledAt`, `crawlDurationMs`, and `classificationRunId`
all set but 0 pages / 0 flows / 0 endpoints — a model asserting a crawl produced
evidence when it produced none. The consumer-side `EmptyModelError` guard
(GeneratorRunner + VerificationRunner) fixed the immediate symptom, but a
follow-on audit (2026-07-13, CC) found the pattern is **systemic** across FORGE's
provenance-bearing artifacts.

## Implicated artifacts (audit 2026-07-13, file:line)

| Artifact | Writer | Violation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **app-model.json + crawl-summary + DB `app_models` row** | `CrawlRunner.ts:217, 229-243, 251-258` | No `modelHasContent` guard on the crawl path — persists `crawledAt`/`classificationRunId` + `page_count:0/flow_count:0` when the crawl found nothing. The **origin** of the pattern. | GUILTY |
| **Verification report** | `VerificationRunner.ts:890-895` (score), `942-980` (write) | Score defaults `elementsTotal>0 ? … : 0.6` and `flowsTotal>0 ? … : 0.4` sum to **1.0 → HIGH / "Model is ready"** when 0 elements and 0 flows were verified; DB `runs` row `status:'passed'`. Empty-*result* is unguarded (the `:143` guard covers an empty *model*). | GUILTY — highest severity |
| **Streaming run row** | `ForgeStreamingReporter.ts:193-234`, default `:209` | `outcomeStatus = this.failed > 0 ? 'failed' : 'passed'` — a run reaching `onEnd` with `total_tests:0` is reported `passed`. No "did anything run?" check. (Abort-before-`onEnd` is honest: `running` → `interrupted`.) | GUILTY (partial) |
| **run-history.json + DB run row** | `results-store.ts:230-314, 444`; outcome `:364` | Zero-spec results file → `status:'passed'` + zero stats. True abort refuses to write (`:186-189`). Partially mitigated by the TD-067 `inputHealth`/`inputHealthReason` verdict stamped alongside. | PARTIAL |
| **GenerationManifest** | `GeneratorRunner.ts:315-340`, guard `:152` | Fully-empty model guarded (`EmptyModelError`), but a *partially* empty model (pages > 0, flows = 0) still stamps `generatedAt`/`durationMs`/`classificationRunId` next to `specCount:0`/`observedFlows:0`. No per-category guard. | PARTIAL |
| **HealStore** | `HealStore.ts:112-160, 33` | — | **CLEAN — the reference pattern** |

## Decision
1. Execution metadata is wrapped in an explicit **nullable container** (e.g.
   `app.crawlMetadata: CrawlMetadata | null`); a no-execution artifact carries
   `null`, and the crawl-execution fields (`crawledAt`, `crawledBy`,
   `crawlDurationMs`, `pagesDiscovered`, `pagesSkipped`, `aiBudgetStatus`) live
   *only* inside it. `classificationRunId` is a distinct event (classification,
   not crawl) and is tracked separately, not inside `crawlMetadata`.
2. An explicit `evidenceState` (`'onboarded' | 'crawled' | 'crawled-empty'`)
   records that a crawl ran and whether it found evidence. **An empty crawl is a
   successful execution with a diagnostic result (auth wall, SPA hydration
   timeout, bot blocker) — record it, never erase it.**
3. Every derived-outcome field (verification confidence, run status) is derived
   from evidence or is `unknown`/`insufficient-evidence`. No passing defaults.

## Consequences
- Producer-side fix at the source (`CrawlRunner`) rather than downstream
  consumer guards.
- Schema + SQLite migration required (`app.required` currently hard-requires the
  crawl fields; `app_models.crawled_at` is `NOT NULL`). See the follow-up TDs.
- The verification confidence default (`VerificationRunner.ts:890-895`) and the
  run-outcome default (`ForgeStreamingReporter.ts:209`) are their own fixes, not
  folded into the model work.

## Follow-ups
- **TD-UI-029** (CRITICAL) — VerificationRunner zero-evidence → 1.0/HIGH.
- **TD-UI-030** (High) — ForgeStreamingReporter zero-spec → `passed`.
- **TD-UI-031** (High) — CrawlRunner is the origin; fix the producer. Absorbs the
  original TD-UI-028 scope.
- **TD-UI-032** (Medium) — GenerationManifest partial-empty case.
