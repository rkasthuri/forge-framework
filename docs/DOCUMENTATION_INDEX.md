This file is a pure documentation map. It does not define governance, required
reading order, architecture, operational behavior, or project status.

- Human and AI navigation begins at [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md).
- Implementation agents must begin at [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
- The authority classes and trust order are explained in `START_HERE.md`.
- Metadata for new or modernized documents is available at
  [`templates/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md`](templates/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md).

1. Current code, tests, migrations, configuration, and CI workflows outrank
   explanatory documents for implemented behavior.
2. ADRs explain why decisions exist; preserve their historical rationale.
3. Operational guides explain use and must be verified against executable
   behavior.
4. Status and snapshot documents do not define current truth.
5. Historical material is not operational guidance.
6. Readers and AI agents must report contradictions and follow the authority
   order in [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md).
